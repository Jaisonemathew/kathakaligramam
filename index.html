							<strong>
							<p>Changing cities or villages names in India is trending and we often see the news that the name has been changed from this to that of that particular city or town. One such major change this time occurred in South India and this news is coming from the village famous for Kathakali dance form worldwide.

							</p>
						</strong>
<strong><p>The Indian map will now represent Ayirur village in Kerala's Pathanamthitta as "Ayirur Kathakali Gramam" as a sign of the prominence given to the dance style Kathakali, famed for its lavishly colorful makeup and costumes.Kathakali performers from a small village on the banks of the Pampa River in this southern Kerala district have been performing tales from the Bible as well as Hindu Puranas for many years, earning them the right to associate their name with the ancient dance style.</p></strong>

							<strong>	"Hindumatha Parishath" which is held every year in the month of February since 1913 for propagating the essence of Hinduism in general and the teachings of PARAMA BHATTARAKA VIDYATHIRAJA CHATTAMBI SWAMIKAL, in particular. Swamiji was a great savant, thinker and philosopher of Kerala. He along with Sree Narayana Guru ushered in the great Rennaisance movement in Kerala 19th and early 20th centuary. The very fact that the Parishath continues to be held for the past 105 years, attracting and enlightening thousands of Hindu devotees, irrespective of caste and creed is itself proof of it wide and sustained acceptability.
