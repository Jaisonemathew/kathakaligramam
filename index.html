							<strong>
							<p>Changing cities or villages names in India is trending and we often see the news that the name has been changed from this to that of that particular city or town. One such major change this time occurred in South India and this news is coming from the village famous for Kathakali dance form worldwide.

							</p>
						</strong>
<strong><p>The Indian map will now represent Ayirur village in Kerala's Pathanamthitta as "Ayirur Kathakali Gramam" as a sign of the prominence given to the dance style Kathakali, famed for its lavishly colorful makeup and costumes.Kathakali performers from a small village on the banks of the Pampa River in this southern Kerala district have been performing tales from the Bible as well as Hindu Puranas for many years, earning them the right to associate their name with the ancient dance style.</p></strong>
